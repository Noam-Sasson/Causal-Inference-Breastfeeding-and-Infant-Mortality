remember to put in report:
1. Class Weights for propensity weighting and weighted calibration plot and brier score (original metrics neglected class imbalance)<br>
2. Data imputation as robustness check <br>
3. Data Imbalance handling techniques - Direct Estimation (using propensity as class weights) <br>
4. Large Data Handling - Aggressive Sampling (check overlap as result of sampling) <br>
5. Inverse Propensity Score as sample weights for models better performance (IPW + Direct Estimation) <br>
6. Bootstrap for very very very... large data
